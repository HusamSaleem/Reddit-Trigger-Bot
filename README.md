# A Reddit Bot!

# Description
- A bot that is made to scrape either endlessly or with a limit subreddit submission comments. It will parse through most of the comments (Not including the ones that are not loaded in initially) then reply to those comments who have a certain "trigger" word. I mainly created this to practice Python more.

# Features
- MongoDB saving comments & post counts
- Two ways to scrape submissions
- Easy to set up for your self

# Technologies used
- PRAW library, MongoDB, I also used an AWS EC2 instance to host this for personal use.

# How to setup
- You will need a registered bot for Reddit first. Here is a great tutorial on how to do that:
